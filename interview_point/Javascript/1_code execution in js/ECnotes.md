code in js run in top down & left right manner
code is executed in a stack known as call stack .
Every piece of code runs inside a bubble i.e execution context
Execution context contains : code ,Common [global /window] + [this] + outer variables [lexically scope]
Global object : is given by env and it is same for every Execution context
Browser : Window object
Nodejs : Global Object
this : it is different for every e.c
Lexical Scoped [Outer variables] : a function will treat variable that are sitting outside it's function definiton i.e jo variable function ki body ke bahar likhe hote unko hi ye outer var ki tarah treat karta hai naaki unko jo function call ke bahar hote h aur uske hi use karta hai
Default Execution context : global execution context -> It is created when code starts running and it is created for the code that's in global area : [the fns and variables that are not not inside any other fn]
New Execution Context : It will only be created when a fn is called and destoryed when all the lines of that function are executed
Execution runs in two phases :
memory allocation (hoisting):
For that execution context
all variables will assigned : undefined
function statements are assigned memory in the heap -> you can call them before theer defintion
Code execution
types of function : Function statement, function expression, IIFEE, arrow function
