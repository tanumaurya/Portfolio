async Arch
CallStack :
all the code that is written in js will run here.
callStack does not wait for an async task completion
Node API/ Web API: all the async tasks like below execute or waits in apis area :
timers : setTimeout, setinterval
HTTP request :
Browser : XMLHTTP request [callback], fetch[promise]
nodejs : HTTP -> callback based and promise based on
async crud functions
Browser eventlistener
DB queries
waiting queue : all the callback of async functions are enqueued before being executed on the call stack
Event loop :
it is an infinite loop that constantly checks your queue for cb functions if there is one and the stack is empty then it will push that function to the stack for execution
event loop will always wait for callstack to be empty then only it will push the cb function in the callStack
Terms
Task

independent task : serially or prallely -> best way is to do it paralley (task)
depndent task : serially (task)
Functions

synchronous : the function in which all the lines are executed in a serial order
asynchronous : the function in which the inital and later part is executed intially and the between part is executed later
When you have to do dependent tasks with async functions -> order of async function should be in serial
